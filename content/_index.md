## Welcome to the KTH Foodtech Digital Fair!

Participate in the competition and win prizes sponsored by the companies hosting the fair events!

You can collect points (or burgers) by clicking on the logo of one of the companies below and take
a quiz or “spin the wheel”. The quizzes consist of 3-5 questions and you get 20 points for every
right answer! The ones who get the most points will win (amazing) prizes!

Companies will also hold online seminars and be part of a panel discussion. You can see the time
for their participation under their logo. By joining any of these events, you will be granted a
redeem code that will give your score a big boost, so much so, that to win it all you will want
to join as many events as possible!

If you are competing, make sure to go through the check-out process by clicking on your burger
score in the upper right corner. This is in order to get your total score registered. Remember
to type in the redeem codes you receive by joining the fair events! If you’re just here to check
out the companies, that’s totally fine too and you won’t need to check out.

To ensure that your points are saved, *avoid using incognito mode* while in the competition!

The results will be collected *June 12th, 23:59*, and you will know shortly thereafter if you are one of our lucky winners.

**Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favour!**
