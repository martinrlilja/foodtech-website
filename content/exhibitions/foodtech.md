**We connect KTH students to the amazing and fast paced world of Foodtech.
Foodtech aims to improve agriculture and food production, the supply chain,
the distribution channels, consumption and waste by the help of technology!**

So, what is Foodtech? We like to think of it as the intersection of food
and technology; the application and use of technology to improve agriculture
and food production, the supply chain, the distribution channels and ultimately
consumption. Basically, this covers everything from the innovation of new
amazing food products like Oumph or Oatley iKaffe to urban farming, delivery
solutions and Foodtech IoT solutions!

We have identified the following:

 * Knowing about Foodtech is still pretty hipster
 * Foodtech companies have a huge demand for talented students to help them
    save the world
 * Students want to have a more sustainable diet and are very curious about more 
    plant-based alternatives

Therefore, our mission is to:

 * Make Foodtech mainstream by educating the students of KTH how Foodtech 
    could be the main driver to save the planet as well as show how exciting food 
    technology is
 * Inspire students to be part of this incredibly fast growing and vibrant industry 
    and match their talents with awesome Foodtech companies
 * Showcase how many different amazing plant-based food options we have 
    today by letting the students get first-hand experience in order to make it 
    easier to make greener food choices.
