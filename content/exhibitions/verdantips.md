Verdantips is more than just a “green TripAdvisor” that connects eco-conscious diners with
sustainable restaurants in their vicinity. Through the app, users are able to find dining
options that align with their personal sustainability values whether it is just "vegan or
vegetarian" or "plastic free" or "efficient water use" or "renewable energy" or more, without
compromising their taste buds. Sustainable restaurants are able to market their achievements
and practices and receive recommendations on the best areas to improve to make the biggest
impact on their carbon footprint while attracting the most customers. The sustainability
criteria used in the platform include animal product usage (vegetarian, vegan, flexitarian),
food sourcing (meat from regenerative farms, produce grown using urban farming techniques,
locally sourced), green energy usage, water usage, plastic usage, waste practices and much more.
Thereby, creating a diverse platform for people to match their values and connect.

We are three female engineers from three continents, connected by our passion to make the food
sector sustainable. Over the years, we changed our lifestyles to become more climate neutral,
and food remained the major area that was untapped. The ambiguity around what is sustainability
in a restaurant, what green practices are they following, is vegan the only way to be sustainable
etc. were questions that bothered us individually. When we met during our masters degree, we
shared our struggles with each other and united to fix this.
