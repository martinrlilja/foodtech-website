A₂O is our formula for great taste experiences combined with a sustainable production
process. We are exclusively working with new protein alternatives, and in this case,
the yellow pea is our main ingredient. The yellow pea is 100% natural, has no additives,
and is harvested in the plains of Småland. Further, it has been fermented to bind the
flavors in the best possible way. This is simply environmentally friendly food from
start to finish!
