Mark Post unveiled the world's first slaughter-free hamburger at a packed conference in
London and the start of Mosa meats followed. Mosa meat was started with the aim to
commercialise lab grown meat. Their focus now is to find scientific breakthroughs that
lower the price of the product and enable an upscale of the production process.

The meat product starts as a sample from livestock which is then cultured. The sample
contains stem cells of muscles which creates new muscle cells in a live animal when a
muscle is injured. The cells are placed in a medium containing all components needed for
growth in a bioreactor. They proliferate and are then forced to differentiate into muscle
cells by removing growth factors. Myotubes, a primitive muscle fibre, are created by muscle
cells and these are then placed in a gel where muscles fibres can form. These muscle fibres
then grow into small strands of muscle tissue which can then be layered to create meat.
