We love cheese. We love yoghurt. Ice cream too, and so many other animal based products
that are fundamental to our culture and heritage. But using animals to produce these
goodies is extremely wasteful and destructive.

In early 2019, Sorosh Tavakoli and Anja Leissner, started Noquo Foods to challenge the
status quo and re-invent the foods we love, starting with cheese.

The non-dairy cheese products are seeing lower adoption than other products in the
category indicating unimpressed consumers. We agree. The most popular vegan cheeses
are made of coconut oil and starch. These are cheap and accessible but with an unimpressive
experience. Then there’s the premium desert cheeses made from cashew nuts. These are
expensive and cover only a niche category. This highlights a big hole in the cheese
market (pun intended).

Instead of coconut or cashews, Noquo Foods is making cheese out of legumes that are formed
into what is called a “stable matrix.” This will allow the cheese to slice, melt, and
taste like the real thing, and also have more protein than some other vegan options.

Initially Noquo Foods will sell plant-based cheese to foodservice providers in Sweden in a
similar model to Impossible Foods or Oatly. Down the road the aim is to create their own
branded product line for retail.
