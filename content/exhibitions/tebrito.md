Tebritos goal is to transform the protein supply of the future. In order to feed a growing
population, action is needed towards making our eating habits more sustainable to minimize
the effect on climate. Insects are very efficient in converting biomass to high quality
proteins and oils. It's possible to produce them in large scale in automated facilities,
using side streams from the cereal industry.  That's making them both sustainable and very
economically viable.

Tebrito is therefore specialising in processing the food needed in the future. They have
developed a new protein food derived from insects. The product is 88% percent pure, neutral
in taste, white in colour and has promising functional properties.
