Klimato offers a digital tool for restaurants to work with sustainability, by calculating,
communicating, calibrating and compensating the CO2 emissions from food.  Klimato's
web-calculator has integrated the LCA (life-cycle assessment) data for different food items
from RISE and made it very easy to visualise the net CO2e impact of different dishes. With
Klimato, you are able to:

 * **Calculate:** Create recipes based on ingredients, production method and country of origin
    to quickly retrieve the exact CO2e-impact of each dish.
 * **Communicate:** Demonstrate transparency, inspire and encourage the consumer to choose more
    climate-smart choices with climate-marked menus!
 * **Calibrate:** Set climate targets, reduce emissions and show your progress to customers
    and employees with monthly and yearly climate reports. We’ll help you along the way!
 * **Compensate:** We help you offset unavoidable emissions through investments in Gold
    Standard certified projects.

Our climate-labels allow communicating the "environmental-friendliness" of the dishes to the
customers, and many of our customers, such as Bastard Burgers, Favo, Sodexo or Clarion Hotel,
have therefore increased the sales of their vegetarian and vegan dishes!
