## Crickets, a Solution to a Sustainable Earth!

With a relatively short history of operations, our company is already known as a key player
in the alternative protein businessâ€¦

Managed by a team of professionals from Sweden and Thailand, we have constructed a process
factory and an R&D cricket farm based on vertical farming and other innovative solutions
that have given us the knowledge needed to scale up to our first EntoPark planned to be ready by 2020.

The EntoPark takes the cricket farming to new dimensions and takes Global Bugs a great
step further to become one of the largest scale lowest cost producer of alternative
protein from crickets.
