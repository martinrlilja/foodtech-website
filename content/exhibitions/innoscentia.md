The best before dates has reached their best before date!

About 10% of the total food waste globally can be traced to confusion and faulty use of
best-before-dates which is the area we want to enhance. We develop sensor based analogue
and digital indicators of real time food status to prolong shelf and consumption time,
thereby reducing waste costs and food waste. At the moment we are working with two
versions of the technology, one analogue and one digital. Our aim is to reduce wasted
food due to misuse of best before dates throughout the value chain and battle the
unnecessary monumental environmental impact and multi-billion dollar loss this means
today on a global scale.Currently we have a small team operating from Norrsken House in
Stockholm and an R&D-team based in Hyderabad, India. We continuously run internship programs
but also accept students writing their master thesis in themes aligned with our mission.
