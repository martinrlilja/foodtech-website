30% of all fruits and vegetables produced are thrown away. That’s insane!

We will change that. Through our juices we make sure that all raw products that still have more
to give are taken care of. There’s nothing wrong with the fruit, usually it’s the opposite.
A trivial reason like a damaged fruit box can be the reason an entire box of perfectly fine fruits are thrown away.

In our hands the fruit and vegetables are turned into sustainable produced juices, smoothies, ice
cream and other tasty goods. It can be a bumpy orange, a banana with flaws or a lemon that looks
like it just ate a lemon itself. We control, sort and wash. Dents are cut of. The little we sort
away gets turned into nutritious soil so that new veggies can grow. That’s good!

To work with rescued fruits is a challenge - it requires a lot of hands from our staff that knows
and understands the craftsmanship behind a really tasty juice and it also requires that we let the
natural flow of fruits and vegetables control what we do. A good structure for taking care of fruit
waste is lacking thus making it impossible for us to work with only rescued fruits. When we lack raw
products we buy it from our friends in the business.

When there’s no more fruit and veggies being thrown away we’ve reached our goal. Until then we
promise that we will never stop fighting for a healthy and sustainable world.
